# If you want to make yourown maps just add a 2D array with the name "map" and an index that continues after the previous map. example: map11,map12,map13
# also make sure the mapAmount is correct

# -1 = starting position
#  0 = empty space
#  1 = wall
#  2 = finish

# you can set multiple starting position and multiple fnishes
